                 headquarters of Kasaragod district in the state of Kerala, India.
                  Established in the year 1966, Kasaragod was the first municipal town
                   in the district. It is the northernmost district of Kerala and is

                 <h3>BAKEL FORT</h3>
                 <p>Bekal fort which is one of the largest forts in Kerala was built 
                    in the year 1650 AD. Located in the outskirts of Kerala, the
                     fort was constructed during the reign of the 'King of 
                     Mahodayapuram' in the 'Perumel age'. However, following the
                      decline of the perumals, the fort was acquired by the royal
                      family of Chirakkal. The fort played a major part during the 
                      'Battle of Talikota'. It is also believed that the fort was
                       built in quite a rapid pace so that it can be extensively
                        used during the battle. </p>
